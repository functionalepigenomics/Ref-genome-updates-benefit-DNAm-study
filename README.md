This repository contains codes codes to reproduce the results and figures published in the paper.

"Complete Reference Genome and Pangenome Expand Biologically Relevant Information for Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Analysis Using Short-Read Sequencing and Array Data"

The unambiguous probe sets on the HM450K, EPIC, and EPICv2 arrays assessed by T2T-CHM13, pangenome, and their combination (95 assembles including T2T-CHM13 and 94 assembles from the pangenome), separately, are available for download from https://github.com/functionalepigenomics/Illumina_Infinium_HumanMethylation_BeadChips_Annotation.

### :computer: Unambiguous probes
The repository is organized as follows:

Figures: This folder contains codes for main figures.

notebooks: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that cover all the code related to generating the main figures and the extended data figures of the Brain Cell Atlas project. Each notebook focuses on one figure, making it easy to navigate and reproduce specific results.

data: This folder contains some input data for running the code in the notebooks. Due to the store limitation, some of the large data files are not included in the repository. However, instructions are provided on how to obtain the required data.

results: This folder stores the output files generated by the notebooks.

figures: This folder stores the output figures generated by the notebooks.

scripts: this folder contains codes for supplementary figures, supporting scripts and utilities used in the analysis pipelines. These scripts provide additional functionality and can be used independently or in combination with the notebooks.

Please note that some of the large files in the data and results folders, which are necessary for running the code, are not included in this repository due to their large size. They were uploaded to Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/uploads/11195725).
