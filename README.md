"Complete Reference Genome and Pangenome Expand Biologically Relevant Information for Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Analysis Using Short-Read Sequencing and Array Data"

The unambiguous probe sets on the HM450K, EPIC, and EPICv2 arrays assessed by T2T-CHM13, pangenome, and their combination (95 assembles including T2T-CHM13 and 94 assembles from the pangenome), separately, are available for download from https://github.com/functionalepigenomics/Illumina_Infinium_HumanMethylation_BeadChips_Annotation
